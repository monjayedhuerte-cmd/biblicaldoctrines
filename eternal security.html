    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of Eternal Security</h1>
    <p>Eternal Security, also called the perseverance of the saints, is the biblical truth that all true believers in Jesus Christ are kept secure forever by the power of God. Salvation, once truly received, cannot be lost because it is based entirely on Christ’s finished work, God’s sovereign grace, and the sealing power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h2>I. The Basis of Eternal Security</h2>
    <p>The believer’s security is not dependent on human effort but on the immutable promises of God and the finished work of Christ.</p>
    <blockquote>John 10:28–29 - “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 8:38–39 - “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Peter 1:3–5 - “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature… Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”</blockquote>
    <p>Keypoints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>God initiates salvation.</li>
        <li>Christ secures salvation by His atoning work.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit seals and preserves the believer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. The Guarantee of Salvation</h2>
    <p>Salvation is guarantee because it is based on Christ's Righteousness, not our own.</p>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 1:13–14 - “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 6:37 - “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 8:30 - “…whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.”</blockquote>
     <p>Explanation: The believer is irrevocably called, justified, and glorified in God’s eternal plan. This guarantees eternal security.</p>

    <h2>III. The Role of God’s Power</h2>
    <p>Eternal security rests on God’s omnipotent power, not human willpower.</p>
    <blockquote>Jude 24–25 - “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Philippians 1:6 - “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:”</blockquote>
    <p>Even if a believer struggles with sin, stumbles, or falls temporarily into sin, God’s power preserves their salvation.</p>

    <h2>IV. Warning Passages and Perseverance</h2>
    <p>Scripture warns believers against apostasy, not to imply salvation can be lost, but to encourage perseverance, obedience, and holy living.</p>
    <blockquote>Hebrews 6:4–6 - “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift… if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance…”</blockquote>
    <p>This passage as referring to those who appear to be believers but never truly were regenerated. True believers, by God’s power, cannot fall away permanently.</p>
    <blockquote>1 John 2:19 - “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.”</blockquote>
    <P>Genuine believers are kept by God, while false professors may fall away.</P>


    <h2>V. Assurance of the Believer</h2>
    <p>Believers can have full assurance of salvation.</p>
    <blockquote>1 John 5:13 - “These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:1 - “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>2 Timothy 1:12 - “For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.”</blockquote>
    <P>Believers are encouraged to live in obedience, rejoice in hope, and persevere in faith.</P>

    <h2>VI. Biblical Principles Summarized</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salvation is by grace through faith, not by works.</li>
        <li>God’s power keeps the believer safe eternally.</li>
        <li>Christ’s atoning work secures the believer.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit seals believers as a guarantee.</li>
        <li>True believers persevere, though they may sin or stumble.</li>
        <li>Warnings are given to exhort holy living, not imply loss of salvation.</li>
        <li>Assurance of salvation is possible and biblical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>VII. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>Eternal Security teaches that all true believers are kept by God’s power, no one can pluck them from His hand, and salvation is eternal and secure. Believers are called to persevere, obey, and live faithfully, while false professors may fall away, revealing they were never truly saved. This doctrine promotes assurance, faithfulness, and confidence in Christ’s promises.</p>
