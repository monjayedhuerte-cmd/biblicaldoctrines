    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of Faith</h1>
    <p>Faith is the divinely empowered trust in God, by which a sinner receives salvation, pleases God, and is enabled to live a life pleasing to Him. Faith is both the instrument and evidence of a regenerated heart.</p>

    <h2>I. The Nature of Faith</h2>
    <p>Faith is not mere intellectual assent; it is trust, obedience, and dependence upon God.</p>
    <blockquote>Hebrews 11:1 - “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 1:17 - “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”</blockquote>

    <h2>II. Faith is God-Given</h2>
    <p>Faith is a gift from God, produced by His Spirit, not by human effort.</p>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 2:8–9 - “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Philippians 1:29 - “For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;”</blockquote>

    <h2>III. Faith is the Instrument of Salvation</h2>
    <p>Faith is the means by which we receive Christ and His righteousness.</p>
    <blockquote>John 1:12 - “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 10:9–10 - “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</blockquote>

    <h2>IV. Faith is Evidenced by Works</h2>
    <p>While salvation is not earned by works, true faith produces obedience and good works.</p>
    <blockquote>James 2:17 - “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>James 2:22–24 - “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.”</blockquote>

    <h2>V. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>Faith is always directed to Christ, trusting in His person, work, and promises.</p>
    <blockquote>Acts 16:31 - “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Hebrews 11:6 - “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VI. The Results of Faith</h2>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:1 - “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Philippians 4:7 - “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:7 - “(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 John 5:13 - “These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VII. Faith is for All</h2>
    <p>Faith is offered to all people. Salvation is available to every sinner; the sinner must choose to believe.</p>
    <blockquote>John 3:16 - “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Revelation 22:17 - “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Acts 17:30 - “And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:”</blockquote>

    <h2>VIII. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>Faith is the gift of God, the instrument of salvation, the channel of justification, regeneration, and adoption. It is evidenced by obedience and works, directed entirely to Christ, offered to all men, and preserved by God eternally in the believer.</p>
