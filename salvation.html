    <h1>The Doctrine of Salvation</h1>

    <p>Salvation is the gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ. It is received by faith, not by works, and restores our relationship with God.</p>

    <h2>Key Bible Verses (KJV)</h2>
    <p>Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</p>
    <p>John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
    <p>Romans 10:9 - "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Salvation is the central teaching of the Bible. It means being saved from sin and eternal separation from God. Through Jesus Christ’s sacrifice, believers are forgiven, reconciled with God, and promised eternal life.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Salvation</h2>
    <p>Without salvation, humanity remains under the penalty of sin. Receiving salvation through faith in Jesus allows believers to live in hope, joy, and assurance of eternal life with God.</p>

    <h2>How to Receive Salvation</h2>
    <p>Salvation is received by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repenting of sins (Acts 3:19 - "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.")</li>
        <li>Believing in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (John 3:16)</li>
        <li>Confessing faith in Him (Romans 10:9)</li>
        <li>Living a transformed life according to God’s Word (2 Corinthians 5:17 - "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.")</li>
    </ul>
