    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of Salvation</h1>
    
    <p>Salvation is the sovereign work of God whereby He delivers a sinner from the penalty, power, and ultimately the presence of sin through the Person and finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is <strong>available to all</strong> who believe.</p>
    <h2>I. The Need for Salvation</h2>
    <h3>1. Universal Sinfulness</h3>
    <blockquote>Romans 3:23 - “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 2:1 - “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;”</blockquote>

    <h3>2. The Penalty of Sin</h3>
    <blockquote>Romans 6:23 - “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Revelation 20:14–15 - “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 3:18 - “He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”</blockquote>

    <h2>II. The Source of Salvation</h2>
    <blockquote>John 3:16 - “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 2:8–9 - “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</blockquote>

    <h2>III. The Ground of Salvation</h2>
    <blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:21 - “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Peter 2:24 - “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 19:30 - “When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.”</blockquote>

    <h2>IV. The Means of Salvation</h2>
    <h3>1. Repentance Toward God</h3>
    <blockquote>Acts 20:21 - “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”</blockquote>

    <h3>2. Faith in Jesus Christ Alone</h3>
    <blockquote>Romans 10:9–10 - “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</blockquote>

    <h2>V. The Results of Salvation</h2>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:1 - “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 3:3 - “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Galatians 4:5 - “To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Peter 1:18–19 - “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 10:28 - “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VI. Salvation is for All Men</h2>
    <blockquote>John 3:16 - “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Timothy 2:4–6 - “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 John 2:2 - “And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Revelation 22:17 - “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Isaiah 45:22 - “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Acts 17:30 - “And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:”</blockquote>

    <h2>VII. Balance: God’s Sovereignty and Man’s Responsibility</h2>
    <blockquote>John 6:37 - “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VIII. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>Salvation is wholly of grace, purchased by the blood of Christ, sufficient for all mankind, sincerely offered to every sinner, and freely received by faith alone — resulting in eternal security for those who believe.</p>
