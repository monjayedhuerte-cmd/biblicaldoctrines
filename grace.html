    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of the Grace of God</h1>
    
    <p>Grace is the unmerited favor of God toward sinners. It is divine assistance given freely by God, enabling salvation, sanctification, and perseverance. Grace is entirely of God’s initiative and the foundation of the Christian life.</p>

    <h2>I. The Nature of God’s Grace</h2>
    <p>Grace is favor, power, and blessing from God to those who cannot earn it.</p>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 2:8–9 - “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 3:24 - “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:”</blockquote>

    <h2>II. Grace is the Basis of Salvation</h2>
    <p>All aspects of salvation come from God’s grace.</p>
    <blockquote>Titus 2:11–12 - “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:15–17 - “But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</blockquote>

    <h2>III. Grace is Unlimited in Its Offer</h2>
    <p>Grace is offered to all men but is received by faith.</p>
    <blockquote>John 1:16 - “And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 6:14 - “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>2 Corinthians 12:9 - “And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.”</blockquote>

    <h2>IV. Grace as the Motive for Holiness</h2>
    <p>Grace teaches believers to deny ungodliness and live righteously.</p>
    <blockquote>Titus 2:11–12 - “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 6:1–2 - “What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”</blockquote>

    <h2>V. Grace as the Source of Spiritual Strength</h2>
    <p>Grace enables believers to persevere and resist sin.</p>
    <blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:10 - “But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Hebrews 4:16 - “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VI. Grace is Everlasting</h2>
    <p>Grace is eternal, sustaining the believer throughout life.</p>
    <blockquote>2 Timothy 2:1 - “Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:2 - “By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>John 1:16 - “And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VII. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>The grace of God is unmerited favor, the foundation of salvation, sufficient for every need, empowering for holiness and obedience, available to all but received by faith, and eternal for believers. Grace is the heart of God’s love and the source of victorious Christian living.</p>
