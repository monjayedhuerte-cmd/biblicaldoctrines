    <h1>The Grace of God</h1>

    <p>The grace of God is His unmerited favor toward humanity. It is the foundation of salvation and the Christian life, freely given by God to those who believe in Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h2>Key Bible Verses (KJV)</h2>
    <p>Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</p>
    <p>Romans 3:23-24 - "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."</p>
    <p>2 Corinthians 12:9 - "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Grace is God’s unearned favor, given to sinners who cannot earn salvation by their own deeds. It is the power of God that saves, strengthens, and sustains believers throughout life.</p>

    <h2>Importance of God’s Grace</h2>
    <p>Without grace, humanity cannot be reconciled to God. Grace teaches us humility, forgives sins, and empowers Christians to live righteous lives (Titus 2:11).</p>

    <h2>How to Receive Grace</h2>
    <p>Grace is received by faith in Jesus Christ:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Believing that Jesus died for your sins and rose again (Romans 10:9)</li>
        <li>Accepting God’s gift freely, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9)</li>
        <li>Living under God’s guidance and obeying His Word (Titus 2:11-12)</li>
        <li>Relying on God’s strength in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <p>Living in grace means forgiving others, extending mercy, and trusting God in every circumstance. It transforms how we love, serve, and respond to challenges.</p>
