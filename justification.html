    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of Justification</h1>
   
    <p>Justification is God’s act of declaring a sinner righteous based on the righteousness of Christ, imputed through faith. It is a once-for-all, legal declaration, not earned by works, and it is by grace through faith alone.</p>

    <h2>I. The Meaning of Justification</h2>
    <p>Justification is God’s judicial act by which He pardons sins and declares a sinner righteous.</p>
    <blockquote>Romans 3:28 - “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:1 - “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:”</blockquote>

    <h2>II. The Basis of Justification</h2>
    <p>Justification is grounded in the imputed righteousness of Christ.</p>
    <blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:21 - “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Philippians 3:9 - “…not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:”</blockquote>

    <h2>III. How Justification is Received</h2>
    <p>Justification is received by faith alone.</p>
    <blockquote>Galatians 2:16 - “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 4:5 - “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”</blockquote>

    <h2>IV. The Effect of Justification</h2>
    <p>Justification brings peace with God, freedom from condemnation, and assurance of salvation.</p>
    <blockquote>Romans 8:1 - “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Romans 5:9–10 - “Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:11 - “And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”</blockquote>

    <h2>V. Justification is by Grace Alone</h2>
    <p>Justification is a gift of God’s grace, not a reward for works.</p>
    <blockquote>Romans 3:24 - “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Titus 3:5–7 - “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VI. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>Justification is a judicial declaration of righteousness by God, grounded in Christ’s perfect obedience, received by faith alone, not dependent on human works, resulting in peace, forgiveness, and assurance, and given freely by God’s grace to all who believe.</p>
