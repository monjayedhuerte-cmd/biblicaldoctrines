    <h1>The Church of Christ</h1>

    <p>The Church of Christ is the body of believers called to worship, serve, and spread the Gospel. It is established by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h2>Key Bible Verses (KJV)</h2>
    <p>Matthew 16:18 - "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p>
    <p>Ephesians 1:22-23 - "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."</p>
    <p>Acts 2:42 - "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>The Church is not merely a building or an organization; it is the spiritual body of Christ. Every believer is a member and has a role in worship, service, and evangelism.</p>

    <h2>Importance of the Church</h2>
    <p>The Church provides fellowship, teaching, accountability, and a place to serve God. It is the vehicle through which God accomplishes His work in the world.</p>

    <h2>How to Be Part of the Church</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (Acts 16:31)</li>
        <li>Be baptized for the remission of sins (Acts 2:38)</li>
        <li>Commit to fellowship and learning (Acts 2:42)</li>
        <li>Serve and contribute to the mission of the Church</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <p>Being active in the Church means attending worship, joining Bible studies, helping others, and spreading the Gospel to those around you.</p>
