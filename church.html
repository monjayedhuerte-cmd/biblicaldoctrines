    <h1>📖 The Doctrine of the Church</h1>
    
    <p>The Church is the body of Christ, composed of all true believers. It is a divine institution, established by Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, and called to worship, fellowship, teaching, and mission in the world.</p>

    <h2>I. The Nature of the Church</h2>
    <p>The Church is a spiritual organism and an organized assembly of believers.</p>
    <blockquote>1 Corinthians 12:27 - “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 1:22–23 - “And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Peter 2:9 - “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:”</blockquote>

    <h2>II. The Head of the Church</h2>
    <p>The Church is under the supreme authority of Christ, who governs and protects it.</p>
    <blockquote>Colossians 1:18 - “And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 5:23 - “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.”</blockquote>

    <h2>III. The Purpose of the Church</h2>
    <p>The Church exists to glorify God through worship, edification, evangelism, and fellowship.</p>
    <blockquote>John 4:23–24 - “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 4:11–13 - “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Matthew 28:19–20 - “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Acts 2:42 - “And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.”</blockquote>

    <h2>IV. Ordinances of the Church</h2>
    <p>Two ordinances given by Christ:</p>
    <blockquote>Matthew 28:19 - “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Corinthians 11:23–26 - “For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.”</blockquote>

    <h2>V. Church Government</h2>
    <p>The Church is self-governing under Christ, exercised through elders, deacons, and congregational decision-making.</p>
    <blockquote>Acts 14:23 - “And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1 Timothy 3:1–13 - Standards for elders and deacons demonstrate order, character, and leadership in the church.</blockquote>

    <h2>VI. Unity and Purity of the Church</h2>
    <p>The Church is called to maintain unity in doctrine and purity in practice.</p>
    <blockquote>Ephesians 4:3 - “Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>2 Corinthians 6:14–17 - “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? … Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”</blockquote>

    <h2>VII. Summary Statement</h2>
    <p>The Church is the body of Christ, under His authority, called to worship, fellowship, disciple, and evangelize. It maintains purity, unity, and order, observes the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and glorifies God through obedience and mission in the world.</p>
